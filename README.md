# Drupal Code Quality Checker
---

## Overview

This composer package will provide some basic code quality checks before committing code by using https://github.com/phpro/grumphp. Check out this [Lullabot article](https://www.lullabot.com/articles/how-enforce-drupal-coding-standards-git) for more details.

This has been customised from [vijaycs85/drupal-quality-checker](https://packagist.org/packages/vijaycs85/drupal-quality-checker) for Innoraft needs.


## Install

1. Add `innoraft/drupal-quality-checker` to `composer.json` or just run

    ```bash
    composer require --dev innoraft/drupal-quality-checker
    ```
2. Replace `grumphp.yml` in project's root directory (not Drupal root directory)
with `vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/grumphp.yml.dist`

That's it. Now, all tasks (listed below) run on every `git commit`.

>*Note:* As part of install, GrumPHP adds `pre-commit` hook to repository. Existing `pre-commit` might get [destroyed](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp/issues/416) when install/uninstall.

## Out of the box

1. [PHPCS](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) with Drupal standard.
2. [PHP Lint](http://www.icosaedro.it/phplint/)
3. [YAML Lint](http://www.yamllint.com/)
4. [Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer)
5. [Composer Normalize](https://github.com/ergebnis/composer-normalize)
6. [JSONLint](https://jsonlint.com/)
7. [Trufflehog](https://trufflesecurity.com/trufflehog/)

Long list of additional checks/validators available [here](https://github.com/phpro/grumphp/blob/master/doc/tasks.md#tasks-1).

## To automatically setup all the packages, follow the below steps:

1. For a single-site setup use [setup.sh](setup.sh) and for a **multisite** setup use [multisite-setup.sh](multisite-setup.sh) .
2. Download the [setup.sh](setup.sh)/[multisite-setup.sh](multisite-setup.sh) file and place it outside the docroot.
3. Update **Line 9 of setup.sh / Line 12 of multisite-setup.sh** having the command ``composer require --dev innoraft/drupal-quality-checker``. Use the appropriate environment for your setup. For example, if you are working with Lando, 
   use ``lando composer require --dev innoraft/drupal-quality-checker``. 
4. Update **Line 86 of setup.sh / Line 102 of multisite-setup.sh** having the command ``composer dump-autoload``. Use the appropriate environment for your setup. For example, if you are working with Lando, 
   use ``lando composer dump-autoload``. 
5. From outside the docroot run this command that will make the bash script executable

   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
6. To execute the bash script run this command from outside the docroot 

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
7. After executing the script, a prompt will appear asking for the base directory name , site name and custom theme name, which need to be entered
   ![cmd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fdb6c2e-843b-44a9-9f28-08e8f2470e8f)

8. Few other prompts will appear where consent is needed to download the required package for the configuration

9. When prompted for tasks to run, select any option, as grumphp.yml is already included in the package and will be used for setup, making this selection less critical:

10. After this, please wait for some time for the script to execute and the setup to be completed.


## Incase you want to install them individually, follow the below steps:

## ESLint task Setup

1. Go to custom theme folder and add eslint package with npm
    ```bash
    npm install eslint --save-dev
    npm install eslint-config-airbnb --save-dev
    ```

2. Now run this command at project's root directory
    ```bash
    cp vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/eslintrc.json.dist .eslintrc.json
    ```
    For **multisite** run the following command
   ```bash
    cp vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/eslintrc.json.dist docroot/sites/<sitename>/themes/custom/<themename>/.eslintrc.json
    ```
4. Update bin key for eslint task under grumphp.yml file with relative address to eslint's bin file.

    Example: if your theme name is `drupal_theme` then change it to `web/themes/custom/drupal_theme/node_modules/.bin/eslint`

## Stylelint task Setup

1. Go to custom theme folder and add stylelint package with npm
    ```bash
    npm install stylelint --save-dev
    ```

2. Now run this command at project's root directory
    ```bash
    cp vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/stylelintrc.json.dist .stylelintrc.json
    ```
    For **multisite** run the following command
   ```bash
    cp vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/stylelintrc.json.dist docroot/sites/<sitename>/themes/custom/<themename>/.stylelintrc.json
    ```
3. For **multisite** run the following command
    ```bash
    npm install stylelint-config-standard
    ```
4. Update bin key for stylelint task under grumphp.yml file with relative address to stylelint's bin file.

    Example: if your theme name is `drupal_theme` then change it to `web/themes/custom/drupal_theme/node_modules/.bin/stylelint`

## Trufflehog task Setup

1. Create a new folder `tasks` at project's root level.

2. Now run this command at project's root directory
    ```bash
    cp vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/tasks/SecurityLeaks.php tasks
    ```

3. Now add the following code in your `composer.json` file which is present at project's root directory. ( For reference you can check `composer.json` file of this package )
    ```bash
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "Innoraft\\QualityChecker\\Trufflehog\\": "tasks"
        }
    },
    ```
    Once the code is added in `composer.json` then execute this command
    ```bash
    composer dump-autoload
    ```
4. Install `trufflehog` ( If not already install ). You can execute the following command to achieve the same.
    ```bash
    curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog/main/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $HOME/.local/bin
    ```

5. Please check and confirm if your `grumphp.yml` is updated with `vendor/innoraft/drupal-quality-checker/grumphp.yml.dist` ( Check and confirm if trufflehog tasks & service attribute is added in `grumphp.yml` file )

6. `Trufflehog` is now ready to sniff your secrets `:)`
